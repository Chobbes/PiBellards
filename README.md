=========

A simple Haskell program implementing [Bellard's formula](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellard's_formula)

Installation

It should just install with cabal. You will probably want to install
the [Haskell Platform](https://www.haskell.org/platform/).

    cabal install --bindir=/path/to/where/you/want/the/bin
